# Swift-Bug-Solutions
A catalogue of common Swift bugs and my catalogue of solutions


### Overview:

I found it hard keeping track of all the bugs I found and my different fixes for them so I decided collate them into a GitHub repository. Feel free to browse and let me know if you find any bugs inside by bug fixes or have any suggestions to add. 

### Contents:

#### SwiftUI
- [Nested Observable Objects](SwiftUI/NestedObservableObjects.md)



### Code Layout

Full code examples will be given for the bug example whereas for brevity, solution examples will generally only give the code snippets required to highlight the changes.
